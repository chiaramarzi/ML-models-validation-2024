# ML-models-validation

A repository with examples of validation schemes of machine learning models. 

A Random Forest classifier has been trained, validated and test to perform gene mutation prediction based on neuroimaging features. The investigated sample includes multicenter radiomics features extracted from brain lesions segmented on T1- and T2-weighted MR images of 250 patients.
  * 250 patients, examined in 10 institutions (different MRI scanners and protocols), 25 patients for each institution
  * Each patient presents a brain lesion, visible in 3D T1- and T2-weighted MR images
  * 200 radiomic features (100 from T1-weighted MR image and 100 from T2-weighted MR image) describing the lesion's morphology, contrast, texture, etc.
  * Each patient underwent genetic testing to determine if they had a specific genetic mutation

Performances were evaluted by means of accuracy.
